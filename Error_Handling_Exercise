As a detective 🕵️ at Shadow Sleuths 🥷, you’ll attend mysterious operations using the `mysteryOperation` function. 

If the operation is successful 🍻, it prints to the console; if it fails 🦹, it throws an error!

The bureau gives you 13 days of vacation if an operation is successful, if unsuccessful, you’ll receive one day for your motivation. 

In both situations, they also give you three days for your attendance. This year, you will attend 20 missions. 

Code this logic using `try`/`catch`/`finally`, and print how many days of vacation you deserve!

Hint: Remember, `try` runs until there is an error, `catch` runs when there is an error, and `finally` runs always after both `try` and `catch` finished.

function mysteryOperation ()
{
	const outcome = Math.random(); // Generates a random number between 0 and 1.

	if (outcome < 0.5)
	{
		console.log("The operation is completed successfully!");
	}
	else
	{
		throw new Error("The operation is failed mysteriously!");
	}
}

const totalMissions = 20;  //total number of missions
const successfulMission = 13; //number of days off earned for a successful mission
const failedMission = 1; //number of days off earned for a failed mission
const attendanceDays = 3; //number of days off earned for attendance

let daysOffTotal = 0; //this will record the total days off you deserve

for(let i = 0; i < totalMissions; i++) { //create a loop to iterate through the total number of missions

	try {
		mysteryOperation();					//run the function to determine success or fail
		daysOffTotal += successfulMission; //add days earned for successess
	}
	catch(error) {
		daysOffTotal += failedMission;	//catch the errors to add the days earned for failures
	}
	finally {
		daysOffTotal += attendanceDays;  //finally will run regardless of success or fail to add 3 days for each mission
	}

	

}
console.log(daysOffTotal);  //prints the total number of days off you deserve
